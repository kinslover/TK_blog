# Description

Sort a linked list in $$O(n log n)$$ time using constant space complexity.

# Analysis

It is better to solve this problem with MergeSort than QuickSort, as we do not enjoy random access in a linked list. The easiest way to implement MergeSort is to do it recursively. Though the stack space used by recursion is $$O(logn)$$, which slightly violates the constant space requirement, I do not bother to do a loop-version MergeSort here.

One trick of implementing MergeSort is how we identify the $$mid$$ pointer. The naivest way is to iterate through the list to find the $$mid$$ pointer between $$[left, right]$$ during each recursion. Though the time complexity is still $$O(nlogn)$$, but it suffers from a larger constant. A better way to do it is to utilize the fact that we visit each node in the list following the exactly the same order of the nodes in the list. Thus we make a "global" pointer $$pt$$ indicating which node we are currently at, after visiting which we move ``pt = pt->next``. In this case, after we sort the left part $$[left, mid]$$ by ``sort(pt, nLeft)``, the $$pt$$ pointer will naturally be at $$mid+1$$. Then we can sort the right part by ``sort(pt, nRight)``.

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *sortList(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *pt = head;
        int n = 0;
        while(pt && (++n))
            pt = pt->next;
        if (head)
            head = mergeSort(head, n);
        return head;
    }
    ListNode * mergeSort(ListNode *& head, int num){        
        if (num == 1){ 
        // utilize the property that head is visited sequentially to locate the mid point
            ListNode * cur_head = head;
            head = head->next;
            cur_head->next = NULL;
            return cur_head;
        }

        ListNode * left = mergeSort(head, num/2);
        ListNode * right = mergeSort(head, num-num/2);
                    //head goes to head->next every time a node is visited 
        
        // Merge
        ListNode* cur = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode* cur_head = cur;
        while(left && right){
            ListNode * & nxt = (left->val < right->val )? left:right;
            move_forward(cur, nxt);
        }
        ListNode * & nxt = (right)? right:left;        
        while (nxt)
            move_forward(cur, nxt);        
        
        cur->next = NULL;
        cur = cur_head->next;
        delete cur_head;
        return cur;
    }
    void move_forward(ListNode * & cur, ListNode * & nxt){
        cur->next = nxt;
        cur = cur->next;
        nxt = nxt->next;
