        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
        I am a second year master student in University of Alberta. Here is a detailed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/self_intro">online CV</a> of me. </p> 

        <p>I have done projects on machine learning related to various fields, such as recommendation system based on latent dirichlet allocation, fMRI image classification and bandit online learing. Now I am working with <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~greiner/">Prof. Greiner</a> on applying sparse methods on <a href="http://pssp.srv.ualberta.ca/">patient specific survival prediction</a>.</p>

        <p>My <a href="http://kinslover.info">previous blog</a> will still run in future. I will probably write blogs in Chinese about my life there and in English in this new blog mainly about machine learning, stats, and other topics related to computer science.</p>

        <p>
        <b>I am now looking for a Ph.D position in the U.S. or Canada on the fields related to machine learning.</b>
