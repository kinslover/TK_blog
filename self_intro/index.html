<h2><a id="About me">About me</a></h2>

<p>I am a master student in statistical machine learning program, computing science department, University of Alberta. My general research interests include machine learning and data mining. I am now working on two projects related to bandit online learning and sequential feature selection respectively. My supervisor is <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~greiner/">Prof. Greiner</a>.</p>

			Unified algorithm for bandit online learning and competitive analysis
		</h3>
                <p>
                        2013.3-now, with <b> <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/">Prof. Szepesvári</a></b> and <b> <a href="http://www.szit.bme.hu/~gya/">Dr. György</a></b>

<p>
While competitive analysis and online learning are two frameworks in online decision-making setting, which share several similarities in the problems they study, the difference in the assumptions, goals and even techniques hinders unified analysis and algorithms. There has been a few attempts on this field [1] [4], which achieve good result. However there is no attempt in the field of bandit united anal- ysis and algorithms. What is even worse, to the best of my knowledge, there is no clear definition of bandit competitive analysis setting. This paper defines the bandit competitive analysis setting and propose an unified algorithm that follows the general bandit framework, with the algorithm that can be used for unified MTS/Expert setting and thus the decision set it works on is simplex, as a blackbox. I am now working on discovering the link between the optimal offline loss and the optimal offline loss in the black box.

			Recommendation with latent social information
		</h3>
                <p>
                        2013.2-2013.5, with <b> <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~greiner/">Prof. Greiner</a></b>
                </p>
<p>
The booming development of online social communities raise new challenges for recommendation system researchers: how to incorporate social information into recommendation engine to improve the performance of recommendation? In this paper, we propose two new models that derive from the Personal+Latent Social Factor (PLSF) model proposed by and the Social regularization (SR) model re- spectively, but avoid the problems of PLSF and SR. Our two models are both based on the state-of-the-art Mixed Membership Stochastic model, with which we can capture the latent social roles users assume in the social network. The latent roles of users are very essential in personalized recommendations, with the help of which ,our SR model has shown an improvement compared with other traditional or social recommender system.

			ADHD classification based on fMRI images
		</h3>
                <p>
                        2012.9-2012.12, with <b> <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~greiner/">Prof. Greiner</a></b> and <b> <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~dale/">Prof. Schuurmans</a></b>
                </p>

	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder, which affects about 3-5% of school-aged children. In previous researches, only tens of subject data were available to researchers, which rendered the results not very convincible. Recently, the emergence of the ADHD-200 dataset, compiling over 1,000 functional, structural scans and phenotypic data of subjects with and without ADHD, was a milestone which made it possible to set our goal to be automatically diagnosing it by machine learning techniques on this fMRI data. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) is one of the most successful feature descriptors in computer vision. It captures the spatial gradient information between adjacent pixels. As fMRI data is 3D-image, it is intuitive to utilize the 3D gradient information to aid our goal. I proposed a 3D-HOG method that extracts the 3D gradients of fMRI data as the feature descriptors for further classification. With the same preprocessing steps and classifier of Matthew R. G. Brown, my model achieved 62.39% on the prediction accuracy which is better than 59.45% of Matthew R.G. Brown. This fact indicated that the spatial gradient information captures important and key features of fMRI data for ADHD classification task and probably other fMRI-based classification tasks.
